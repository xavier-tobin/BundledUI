# Bundled UI for Jetpack Compose

> A radically simple Material 3 UI design system, built
> for [Bundled Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xaviertobin.noted).

## Why?

The Material3 library for Jetpack Compose is a powerful, flexible component suite for building
beautiful Compose UIs, but it is comprised of atomic components that usually require wrapping and
management of padding, margin and modifiers in order to create a consistent, beautiful UI.

Bundled UI is a higher level library, wrapping Material3 components with a consistent structure.

Benefits

- Lightweight abstraction, minimal dependencies
- Easy to use, hard to mis-use
- Almost no padding or margin management required

# Section

A Section is a card with a few additional properties and features, including:

* onClick support
* Tone support
* focus support
* disabled support
* selected support (i.e can be toggled on/off)
* Automatic margin and padding management
* Orientation

To build your UI, all you need to do is group related Sections, and correctly set the first and last
parameters.
